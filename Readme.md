## Features

- **Carbon Footprint Calculation:** Predicts individual COâ‚‚ emissions based on lifestyle and consumption data.  
- **Personalized Tips:** Suggests sustainable actions to reduce carbon footprint.  
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Instant results powered by a trained machine learning model.  
- **Privacy-Focused:** No user data is stored; all computations are done in real-time.  

---

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React  
  - Responsive UI and interactive components  
  - Users input lifestyle, diet, and transportation habits directly in the browser  

- **Backend:** FastAPI  
  - Handles requests and interfaces with the AI model  
  - Computes predictions in real-time without storing user data  

- **AI Model:** Random Forest Regressor  
  - Predicts individual carbon footprints based on numerical and categorical data  
  - Uses OneHotEncoder to encode categorical features  
  - Robust, accurate, and capable of handling non-linear interactions

## AI & ML Details

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Lifestyle data, energy usage, diet, transportation, and recycling habits are collected.  
   - List-like features (e.g., `Recycling`, `Cooking With`) are expanded into binary flags.  
   - Categorical features are encoded using OneHotEncoder.  

2. **Model Training:**  
   - Random Forest Regressor trained with 200 trees on historical carbon emission datasets.  
   - Splits data into training and testing sets for accuracy evaluation.  

3. **Prediction Workflow:**  
   - Users input their data via the frontend.  
   - Backend encodes categorical features and combines them with numeric features.  
   - The model predicts COâ‚‚ emissions instantly and returns the result.  

4. **Model Benefits:**  
   - Captures complex interactions between features  
   - Robust against missing or noisy data  
   - Provides actionable insights for users
