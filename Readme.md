## Features

- **Carbon Footprint Calculation:** Predicts individual CO₂ emissions based on lifestyle and consumption data.  
- **Personalized Tips:** Suggests sustainable actions to reduce carbon footprint.  
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Instant results powered by a trained machine learning model.  
- **Privacy-Focused:** No user data is stored; all computations are done in real-time.  

---

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Vite)  
  - Fast build and hot-reload with Vite bundler  
  - Responsive UI and interactive components  
  - Users input lifestyle, diet, and transportation habits directly in the browser  

- **Backend:** FastAPI  
  - Handles requests and interfaces with the AI model  
  - Computes predictions in real-time without storing user data  

- **AI Model:** Random Forest Regressor  
  - Predicts individual carbon footprints based on numerical and categorical data  
  - Uses OneHotEncoder to encode categorical features  
  - Robust, accurate, and capable of handling non-linear interactions

## AI & ML Details

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Lifestyle data, energy usage, diet, transportation, and recycling habits are collected.  
   - List-like features (e.g., `Recycling`, `Cooking With`) are expanded into binary flags.  
   - Categorical features are encoded using OneHotEncoder.  

2. **Model Training & Saving:**  
   After training, the model and encoder are saved as `.pkl` files:  
   ```python
   with open("carbon_model.pkl", "wb") as f:
       pickle.dump(model, f)

   with open("encoder.pkl", "wb") as f:
       pickle.dump({
           "encoder": encoder,
           "categorical_cols": categorical_cols,
           "numerical_cols": numerical_cols
       }, f)

   print("✅ Model & encoder saved successfully!")
````

**Note:** After generating these files in the `Ai/` folder, they must be copied into the `backend/` folder so the FastAPI server can access them:

```bash
cp Ai/carbon_model.pkl backend/
cp Ai/encoder.pkl backend/
```

3. **Prediction Workflow:**

   * Users input their data via the frontend.
   * Backend encodes categorical features and combines them with numeric features.
   * The model predicts CO₂ emissions instantly and returns the result.

4. **Model Benefits:**

   * Captures complex interactions between features
   * Robust against missing or noisy data
   * Provides actionable insights for users

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Node.js & npm/yarn
* Virtual environment (`venv`)

### Setup

1. **Activate Python environment**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. **Install backend dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

4. **Ensure AI model & encoder files are in backend**

```bash
cp Ai/carbon_model.pkl backend/
cp Ai/encoder.pkl backend/
```

---

## Usage

1. **Run Backend**

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

2. **Run Frontend (Vite)**

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

3. **Access the app**
   Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) in your browser.

4. **Calculate Carbon Footprint**
   Enter your lifestyle and energy data to get a personalized carbon footprint estimate.

## Future Improvements

* Add more detailed sustainability metrics (water usage, diet-specific emissions).
* Integrate visualization dashboards for tracking progress.
* Include AI recommendations for emission reduction strategies.
* Implement user authentication for personalized history and tracking (optional).
